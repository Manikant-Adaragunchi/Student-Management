# Student-Management - Lab Exam
via Jira

PROBLEM DEFINITION:

In many educational institutions, managing student data such as USN, name, branch, and semester is typically done manually or using outdated methods. This can lead to data inconsistency, difficulty in accessing information, and lack of a centralized system.
To address this, we aim to develop a console-based Student Management System that allows administrators to efficiently add, view, search, and delete student records. The system should provide a simple interface to perform basic operations and maintain accurate student information in an organized manner.

 
 ->Functional Requirements
    1.Add a new student with USN, Name, Branch, and Semester.
    2.Display the list of all students.
    3.Search for a student using the USN.
    4.Delete a student record by USN.
